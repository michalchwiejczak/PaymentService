# Java developer exercise 
 
Prepare a simple service, which will let the client store and read payments.  
 
## Functional requirements 
* Payment is described by: unique identifier created during persistence process, amount, currency, user ID and target bank account number 
* Payments should be stored by the service 
* Service should expose an API, which should be able to: 
* Fetch payment resources 
* Create, update and delete payment resources 
* List a collection of payment resources 

## Non-Functional requirements 
* API should be RESTFUL 
* Application should be able to  store payments in a CSV file 
* The code should be open for extensions, i.e  possibility to add a support for an in-memory database storage, so  the type of storage engine could be passed as a configuration parameter 
* You should use best practices, for example TDD/BDD, SOLID etc. 
* Consider using Clean Architecture or Hexagonal/Ports and Adapters patterns 
* Try to simplify your code by using well  proven open source frameworks and libraries 
* Write the code with production ready quality in mind  

Submitting the exercise Application code should be published on github or gitlab public repository.
